###About
The purpose of this assignment was to:  
    * Generate some code using a testing suite  
    * Compare that to the testing suite we wrote in Assignment 1  
    * Write a *RandomTestDominion.java* to randomly test our dominion game  

###File structure
The assignment is organized as follows:  
    * assignment1  
        1. screen shots of assignment 1 cobertura output included on the writeup  
        2. dominion folder containing all the code from assignment 1  

    * evosuite  
        1. screen shots of the evosuite cobertura output included on the writeup  
        2. dominion folder containing all the code generated from evosuite  

    * manualRandomTests  
        1. dominion folder containing all the tests from assignment 1 with the addition of the *RandomTestDominion.java*

    * coberturaOutput *(contains the cobertura output of the following:)*  
        1. assignment1  
        2. evosuite  
        3. manualRandomTests  

###Building instructions
For the assignment1, evosuite and manualRandomTests folders, the contents are only the *pom.xml* and the src folder containing the code needed to compile new versions  

To build those versions, enter any of the folders and type *mvn test* to run the test  
If you would like to build the cobertura output, type *mvn cobertura:cobertura* and it will build the html files. The web file will be found in *target/site/cobertura/index.html*
