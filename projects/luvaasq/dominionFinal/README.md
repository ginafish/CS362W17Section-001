#Make sure to remove random tests (RegressionTest.java and RegressionTest0.java) from /src/test/ before getting mutation coverage for unit tests!
#For testing my mutation coverage from unit tests, "testCards.java" should be only /src/test/ file.

#Get mutation coverage
mvn clean; mvn compile; mvn package; mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
