*IN ORDER TO VIEW COBERTURA COVERAGE REPORT YOU MUST MANUALLY RUN THE COBERTURA TOOL*
Assuming Cobertura coverage tool is installed:
	To run code coverage:
	"mvn cobertura:cobertura"
	index file is located in
	target->site->cobertura->index.

To run the EvoSuite Tests, manually put all of the tests in the EvoSuiteTests folder into the /src/test/java/ORG... folder with all of the other tests. 

Then in the same directory as the pom file, run:
	mvn test
OR, 

If you want to view the coverage that the evosuite shows, do:
	mvn evosuite:info
and it will show the coverage as it does in my pdf.
