PLEASE DO NOT GENERATE NEW TESTS FROM EVOSUITE. They will most likely be incompatible with
Maven when initially created. 

The following line in Card_ESTest.java was causing a BUILD FAILURE so I commented it out:
import org.evosuite.testcase.execution.CodeUnderTestException;

The EvoSuite test ran successfully after that

To run with Maven:

-mvn compile
-mvn test
-mvn cobertura:cobertura
